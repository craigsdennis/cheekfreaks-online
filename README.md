# Cheekfreaks Online

An exploration using [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) w/ [Hono](https://hono.dev/getting-started/cloudflare-workers) and [LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/cloudflare_vectorize) [abstractions](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/cloudflare_workersai) to build a super music fan that you can chat with.

Lyrics are uploaded as text files to [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/), which is then used to create [embeddings](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/text_embedding/cloudflare_ai) and store them in Cloudflare's vector database [Vectorize](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/text_embedding/cloudflare_ai).

Chat pulls in relevant lyrics via a retriever.

This, like all of us, is a work in progress.
